Describe how to go from correlative studies to studies of causation</h1><p>Correlative studies and causation studies are two major types of studies in soil microbe research area. </p>
<p>Correlative studies allow us to target many relationships simultaneously, and give us direction for further causation studies. Delgado-Baquerizo et al. (2015) analyzed data from two large-scale surveys, a global study including 78 drylands and a national soil survey including 179 locations in Scotland, and concluded that microbial diversity promotes multifunctionality (e.g., nutrient cycling, primary production, litter decomposition and climate regulation ) in terrestrial ecosystems; and is as important as variables such as soil pH, climate and spatial predictors, latitude and altitude in driving multifunctionality. These results gave the direction that microbial diversity is closely linked to soil functionality, however, the result lacks cause-and effect relationship and only shows the relationship rather than causation.</p>
<p>Causation studies give us a definite cause and effect relationship. Trivedi et al. (2019) experimentally showed that microbial functional diversity positively contributed to three specific important specialized ecosystem functions: nitrification, denitrification and methane flux. He was able to demonstrate that reduction of microbial diversity reduced ecosystem function as regards. </p>
<p>Key to enabling causation studies is to change the target variable while control all other variables the same. Trivedi (2019) collected two sets of samples, one from Goolgowi mallee and the other from Warraderry State. Within each set of samples, the soils were collected from the same geological site. In this way all original samples within the same set were taken from the same environment and latitude, and thus were expected to have the same soil type. They used dilution-to-distinction method to create a gradient of microbial diversity. The more dilution samples were expected to have lower microbial diversity.  In this way Trivedi and his colleagues were able to control initial bacterial diversities. Compared to Delgado-Baquerizo et al. (2015)â€™s analysis using samples from multiple sites,  Trivedi et al. (2019) experiment eliminated cofounding variables by using samples from the same site. Controlling environmental factors and the initial microbial diversity enabled them to conduct a causation experiment.</p>
<p>Trivedi et al. successfully showed that reduction in microbial diversity lead to reduction in soil functionality in their experiment. They confirmed the reduction of microbial functional diversity by measuring key functional genes including <em>amoA</em> gene (for ammonia-oxidising archaea), <em>nosZ</em> gene (for N2O reducing bacteria), and <em>pmoA</em> gene (for methanotrophs). And they measured soil functionality including CH4 flux, NO3 production, and N2O flux. They plotted the data and by using the experimental design, and were able to confirm that functional groups can cause the reduction in soil functionality. (For example, in Figure 3 below, reduction in nitrifier diversity leads to reduction in nitrate availability).</p>

<p>In conclusion, correlation experiments provide correlations which give direction to further causation studies, and causation studies give definite cause and effect relationship. Causation relationships are usually examined by experiments with control variables. </p>
