  <p>#4. What are 2 important practical/applied outcomes from microbiome research. </p>
<p>Soil microbiome researches have many practical purposes. </p>
<p>Dr Hu’s review article (2017) discussed about the role of microbiomes in N2O emission in dryland. N2O is ten times more powerful than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, and dryland is accounted for 30% of total gaseous nitrogen emissions on Earth (Hu, 2017). Thus it is very important to understand the mechanisms and pathways for dryland NO2 emission to better control it. Crenshaw  found that fungi denitrifies were identified as the dominant source of dryland N2O emission, as they better cope with the dryland environment. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) also takes part in N2O emission (et al, 2008), but to a lesser extend since majority of AOB stays less active or dormant in dry conditions et al., 2015b, 2016) </p>

<p>According to these findings, Dr Hu suggested that dryland N2O emission treatment should be different compared to other wet conditions due to the different composition of active P cycling microorganism and their mechanisms. Also through studying of specific biomolecular pathways of microorganisms for N2O emission, we know that a main pathway is by ammonia oxidiser converting NH4+ to NO3, and then denitrifies converting NO3 to N2. N2 is then released into the atmosphere and may later be converted to N2O. Dr Hu thus proposed some potential solutions to reduce N2O emission, such as 1)using nitrification inhibitor to stop the conversion of NH4+ to NO3- thus stop further mechanisms happening. 2) Using particular plants to compete for soil N or inhibit microorganisms’ pathway to produce N2O (breeding or engineering plants with high N use efficiency or capability to release biological nitrification inhibitors).  Thus, further understandings of microbial’s roles in N2O emission helps us to come up with a more comprehensive solution to control N2O emission.</p>
<p> Alan E. Richardson and Richard J. Simpson’s (2011) review article focused on potential of using phosphorus cycling soil microorganisms to increase soil P availability to plants. In order for organic P in soil to be used by plants, P source needs to be mineralized (hydrolyzed) by a set of enzymes called phosphatase enzymes. Lim et al. (2017) has found that soil microorganisms can produce a range of phosphatases and can use P from various forms of organic P that occur in soil in lab settings. This includes inositol phosphates such as phytate and myoinositol hexakisphosphate , which are main types of organic phosphorus in soil. Bu ̈nemann (2008) has reported that up to 60% of the hydrolyzation of organic phosphorus may be done by phosphatases, with phytases done the most amount. Plants also have the ability to release phosphatases, however, Tarafdar et al (2011) reported that there was evidence that microbial enzymes have a higher efficiency than plant enzymes for P release. Based on the studies above, there is thus a potential to use soil microbial enzymes to help plants obtain more P from organic soil P source. </p>
