  <p>#3. Nowadays, instead of using traditional pure-culture based method, many soil microbiome studies are using other procedures such as metagenomics, in situ studies or glasshouse studies to gain additional benefits for the studies.</p>
<p>Metagenomics is can be used in experiments to used in experiments to simultaneously recover large numbers of gene sequence. This is particularly important , where he tried to examine dominant bacteria communities in soil. He examined 123 global soils, and used 16s RNA to identify bacteria types. He found that only 511 out of 25,224 bacterial phylotypes (2%)were dominant , but these 2% phylotypes accounts for 41% of 16S rRNA gene sequences across all samples. He was only able to simultaneously identify this huge amount of bacterial types by examining their genes by metagenomics. He would not be able to recover those bacterial phylotypes by pure-culture in a reasonable time frame. </p>
<p>In situ study means that the study takes place in the original living place of the microorganism without isolating it out. Many soil microbiome species have symbiosis relationship with other organisms, and may die or change in metabolism if were isolated out. In situ study allows those organisms to be studied properly if characterized correctly. Also biotic and abiotic factors can affect the growth and metabolism of many soil microbiomes, and it is only accurate when we account for all those factors. For example, water deficit can affect N2O emission rate of soil microbiomes in dry land (Hu, 2017). And different diversity and distribution of ascular plants, biocrusts and livestock grazing are also likely to influence N2O emissions in land. So if we want to study N2O emission in dryland due to soil microorganisms, in situ study is needed instead of lab settings, as different environment greatly changes the composition and activities of N2O emission microspecies. </p>
<p>Glasshouse study in soil microbiome study usually involves in growing sample in a sealed glass chamber, and control the variables we want for a controlled experiment. Trivedi (2019) used a glasshouse study to show reduction of soil microbiome functionality diversity results in decrease in soil functionality. In order to measure methane consumption to test the hypothesis that decrease in methanotroph diversity result in decrease in methane consumption, he puts samples of soils with different methanotroph diversities into individual sealed glass chambers. He then was able to keep all other factors in the glass chambers the same (eg. Same temperature, same moisture). The use syringes connected to the glass chambers to take out gas from the chamber on time 0, 30, 60 min, and thus calculate rate of methane consumption within each chamber. The glasshouse study allows Trivedi to do a controlled study and he successfully obtained a result supporting his hypothesis. </p>
<p>In conclusion, pure-culture is an easy way to isolate and study organisms, however, for the purpose of some experiments, metagenomics, in situ, and glasshouse studies are more suitable for accurate results. </p>
