  <p>#3. Nowadays, instead of using traditional pure-culture based method, many soil microbiome studies are using other procedures such as metagenomics, in situ studies or glasshouse studies to gain additional benefits for the studies.</p>
<p>Metagenomics can be used to simultaneously recover a large number of gene sequences. This is particularly important in Delgadoâ€™s experiments (2018) where they tried to examine dominant bacteria communities in 123 global soils. They used 16s RNA gene to identify the taxonomic information of the bacterial community. They found that only 511 out of 25,224 bacterial phylotypes (2% of the total phylotypes) were dominant , but these 2% phylotypes accounted for 41% of 16S rRNA gene sequences across all samples. They were able to simultaneously identify this huge amount of bacterial phylotypes by examining their genes using metagenomics. They would not be able to recover those bacterial phylotypes by pure-cultured method in a reasonable time frame. </p>
<p> <em>In situ</em> studies take place in the original living place of the microorganisms without isolating them out. Many soil microbial species have symbiosis relationship with other organisms, and may die or change in metabolism if they are isolated from the original environment. <em>In situ</em> study allows those organisms to be studied properly if characterized correctly. In addition, biotic and abiotic factors can affect the growth and metabolism of many soil microbiomes, and it is only accurate when we account for all those factors. For example, water deficit can affect N2O emission rate of soil microbiomes in drylands (Hu et al., 2017). Different diversity and distribution of vascular plants, biocrusts and livestock grazing are also likely to influence N2O emissions in drylands (Reynolds et al. , 2007). Therefore, if we want to study N2O emission in dryland due to soil microorganisms, <em>in situ</em> study is preferred over laboratory settings, as different environments greatly change the composition and activities of N2O emission microspecies. </p>
<p>Glasshouse study in soil microbiome study usually involves in growing samples in climate-controlled growth chambers, and control the variables throughout the period of the experiments. Trivedi et al. (2019) used a glasshouse study to show that the reduction of soil microbiome functional diversity resulted in a decrease in soil functionality. In order to measure methane consumption to test the hypothesis that decrease in methanotroph diversity results in decrease in methane consumption, they put soils samples with different methanotroph diversities into individual sealed glass chambers. They able to keep all other factors in the glass chambers the same (e.g. same temperature, same moisture). They used syringes connected to the glass chambers to collect gas samples from the chamber at 0, 30, 60 min, and thus calculated the rate of methane consumption within each chamber. The glasshouse study allows Trivedi et al. to do a controlled study and they successfully obtained a result supporting his hypothesis. </p>
<p>In conclusion, pure-culture based study is an important way to isolate and study organisms, however, for the purpose of some experiments, metagenomics, <em>in situ</em>, and glasshouse studies are more suitable for accurate results. </p>
