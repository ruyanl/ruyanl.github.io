Describe 3 key aspects on the interplay between a microbiome and its surrounding environment"></a>2. Describe 3 key aspects on the interplay between a microbiome and its surrounding environment</h1><p>Soil microbiomes can interplay with its surrounding environments in many ways, and three typical ways are through nitrogen cycling, mycorrhizae and phosphorus cycling. </p>
<p>Firstly, soil microbiomes and their surrounding abiotic environment can interplay with each other in biogeochemical nitrogen cycling processes. Soil microbiomes take part in fixation or emission of atmospheric N through key processes such as N fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. Nitrogen fixation is a process by which atmospheric N is converted to ammonia or related nitrogenous compounds in soil through the pathway N2+6H+=2NH3. About 97% of natural N inputs in soils come from those N fixing soil microbiomes. Soil microbiomes for ammonification turn organic N to ammonium, which can be uptaken by plants or used by soil microbiomes. In nitrification, nitrifiers turn ammonia to nitrate via nitrite, and in denitrification, denitrifies turn nitrate back to N2O and nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere again. Thus, soil microbiomes are essential to the N cycling through converting back and forward atmospheric N and organic N in soil. </p>
<p>The surrounding abiotic environment can also impact the ability of soil N-cycling microorganisms. Barton et al. (2013) has found that drylands has a constant N2O emission during dry seasons, but N2O emission increases immediately after the drylands are wetted, for example after rainfall. This “wetting pulse” pattern can be explained as water, as an abiotic factor, influencing N transforming processes in soil microbiomes. During dry season, water deficiency causes lower rates of substrate transport to microbes, and reduces intracellular enzyme activities in soil microbiomes, which reduces N cycling microorganisms’ ability to cycle N. During wet season, however, water stress is removed, and this causes bursts of intracellular solutes release from soil microbiomes (Hu et al., 2017). Water, thus affects soil microbiomes as a abiotic factor.</p>
<p>Secondly, soil microbiomes and plants can interreact with each other, and mycorrhizae is a typical symbiosis. Mycorrhizae is the mutualistic relationship between fungi and plants root. Mycorrhizal fungi come into direct contact with plant root, either ectomycorrhizae (fungal hyphae go between plant root cells) or endomycorrhizae (fungal hyphae penetrate into plant root cells). By this close association, fungi promote the plants’ ability to absorb inorganic minerals and water from the soil through the fungal hyphae. In return, the plants feed the fungus sugars produced during photosynthesis. More than 90% of all land plants have a mycorrhizae relationship with fungi, and this is believed to be one of the oldest relationships, that is around 450 mya according to fossil records. Mycorrhizae is one of the most important associations between plants and fungal species, and is important for the survival of both. </p>
<p>Furthermore, soil microbiomes also interplay with surrounding biotic environment through phosphorus (P) cycling. P-cycling soil microbiomes turn sparing P in soil that is difficult to be used by plants and microbiomes to more accessible P source by 1) increasing plant root system by mycorrhizal association or hormonal stimulation; 2) altering sorption equilibria and increase transfer of orthophosphate ions into soil solution; 3) catalysing metabolic process directly solubilizing and mineralizing P from sparingly available forms of soil P (Richardson &amp; Simpson, 2011). In this way, soil microbiomes help plants better obtain P from soil for growth. After plants die, it is degraded by microorganisms and the P goes back to soil and becomes soil P, which then become used by soil microbiomes and other plants. </p>
